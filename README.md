# Finch-Collector-Deliverable-SEI

AAU, I want to be able to navigate to separate pages for About and All Finches using a navbar

AAU, when I visit the About page, I want to view some details about the finchcollector application.

AAU, when I visit the All Finches page, I want to view a list of all finches (index view) that displays each of the attributes of a finch.

AAU, when I click on a cat in the cat list, I want to see a page that displays all the details for that cat.


### Development steps

1. Start by adding the url, to the urls
2. Create the view function associated with that url
3. Make the html template for that view
4. Add some functionality(UI) to quickly get to that template
